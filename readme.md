# TypeScript DrawShapes - basic version

**By Ben C.**

This project is a requirement for my .NET Fullstack course.

This program needs to ask the user to choose between a **square**,**rectangle** or a **triangle**, and then select its composition:
1) *shape* with * fill.
2) *shape* with * borders.
3) *shape* built out of ascending numbers.
4) *shape* built out of descending numbers.
